# Planned Features

## Setlist Mode

A performance mode for organizing and navigating through a sequence of pieces for concerts or practice sessions.

### Planned Functionality:
- Create named setlists from your music library
- Drag and drop to reorder pieces within a setlist
- Quick navigation between pieces in the setlist during performance
- Optional auto-advance to next piece after reaching the last page
- Setlist-specific annotations that don't affect the main library
- Performance timer/stopwatch for each piece
- Notes field for each piece in the setlist (tempo, key changes, etc.)
- Export setlist as PDF program

## Future Considerations
- Multi-device sync
- Shared annotations with band members
- Metronome integration
- Audio recording linked to annotations
- MIDI foot pedal support for hands-free page turns
